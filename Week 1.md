# Week 1
Chose Electron as my choice for GUI programing as I thought this would be relevant to me for my future and creating web apps has been something I've been keen on learning for sometime. Learning Javascript was also a big pull for me that pushed me to learn Electron.
Joined Git Hub - thought I'd give this a try this semester as an alternative to Bitbucket.
Test Repo created to refresh memory with repos and git bash - it's been 8 months since last done any programing!
Just finding feet again this week watched a couple of youtube videos on the history of electron and how it works.

Learn't about node and NPM - essential to understanding what electron is and how it works
As per week 1 tutorial, installed necessary files(GIT, VS Code and Node) and made first basic electron app!
Explored the app to see how the app was constructed.
