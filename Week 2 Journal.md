# Week 2
Talked about the importance of planning when developing apps and also covered some basic GUI practices and conventions that should be consiered during app development such as:

**Curly's Law: Do One Thing**

A variable should mean one thing, and one thing only. It should not mean one thing in one circumstance, and carry a different value from a different domain some other time. It should not mean two things at once. It must not be both a floor polish and a dessert topping. It should mean One Thing, and should mean it all of the time.

### Some practices to thinkg about when planning your GUI:

1.  KISS. (Keep it simple stupid)
2.  Reduce the learning curve of a new user.
3.  Lead the expectations of the user and let your program behave according to those expectations.

**Emphasized the importance of planning**
Not only relating to wireframing but also when thinking of functionality

Also spent more time watching youtube tutorials on electron development
